# introduction
My project is an exhibition for the International Automobile Company
 where the consumer enters my website and chooses the company and surveys the cars he wants.
  I have used the following in my project:

- HTML
- CSS
- javaScript
- Bootstrap
- jQuery


  # Requirement the project:

Designing a page for the user where he registers on my own site using a username, email and password
Where it allows him to open a personal account for him on the site and through it he enters the general page of the site and browses and surveys the existing companies and cars in each company and chooses the car he wants
